## Why a DIY Badge? Where the idea came from?
On our BSides badge from 2015 participants had the option to solder a simple button to the badge. That simple experience was the first time to solder something for a some. The ones brave enough to solder the part enjoyed the experience. A few years after we went to Defcon, during and realize the solder activity at the hardware hacking villeage was very popular. Then at our 2018 Hackerlab we offer for sale a few simple kits for people to solder. They were a great success. So all pointed that is well received hands on experiences. So 1+1=2, we decided to do a full DIY badge (the idea was in the making for a few tries). This is an experiment but hacking is about trying stuff and see how it goes. If you want to know how it went, contact any participant of the activity and see how it went (this writing is from before the acticity).


## Where parts are sourced?
All parts came from ebay mostly from somewhere in china. For a serious production quality hardware it may not be recomended to do so, but for a prototype like it's been a great way to get the parts. Of course should be ready to wait for parts to arrive (from 3 to 6 weeks or maybe more).

## Can I change badge firmware?
Of course! that's the ide, fire up Arduino and hack your heart out.
